Duration: July to August 2024

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze historical stock market data and develop a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future stock prices. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to capture the temporal dependencies in stock price movements and provide accurate predictions.

Key Activities:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Collect historical stock market data from reliable sources.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize the values, and prepare it for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conduct EDA to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and visualize key features.
   - Generate plots and statistics to gain insights into stock price movements.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create additional features that may improve the predictive power of the model.
   - Consider technical indicators like moving averages, volume, volatility, etc.

4. Model Development:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Develop an LSTM model to learn from the historical stock prices and predict future prices.
   - Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compare the predicted prices with actual prices to assess the accuracy.

6. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices.
   - Create comprehensive reports summarizing the findings, model performance, and potential improvements.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks:
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and documentation

Conclusion:
The project aims to build a robust predictive model using LSTM to forecast stock prices accurately. By leveraging historical data and advanced deep learning techniques, the model can provide valuable insights for investors and traders to make informed decisions.
